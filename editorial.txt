There's EX+BEZ

First OD
of IN
all ABN
, ,
the AT
admitting VBG
physician NN

the AT
VA NN

gets VBZ
the AT

He PPS

If CS
the AT
doctor NN

he PPS
wants VBZ

study VB
the AT
patient NN

As CS

it PPS
takes VBZ
a AT
little QL

it PPS

on IN

the AT

physician NN

the AT

physician NN

the AT

Toward IN

how WRB

When WRB

A AT
