the AT

Hence RB

To TO
grasp VB
our PP$

we PPSS
have HV
to TO
appreciate VB
first OD

how WQL
small JJ

I PPSS

been BEN
trying VBG

make VB
this DT
clear JJ
to IN
my PP$

in IN

One CD
night NN
there EX

some DTI
dried VBN

lying VBG
on IN
our PP$
kitchen NN

, ,
and CC
these DTS

looked VBD
to IN
me PPO
like CS
a AT
little AP
group NN
of IN

; .
; .
and CC
I PPSS
asked VBD
myself PPL
a AT
question NN
: :
Suppose VB
I PPSS
had HVD
the AT
same AP
number NN

as CS
there EX
are BER

in IN
my PP$

, ,
how WRB
large JJ
an AT

would MD
they PPSS
cover VB
? .
? .
I PPSS
calculated VBD
first RB
that CS
there EX
are BER
about RB
an AT
octillion CD

in IN
the AT

human JJ

; .
; .
that DT
is BEZ
a AT
figure NN
one CD
with IN
27 CD
ciphers NNS
, ,
quite ABL
a AT
large JJ
number NN

Then RB
I PPSS
calculated VBD
that CS
a AT

would MD
just QL
about RB
fill VB
a AT

a AT

would MD
fill VB
a AT
small JJ
house NN
from IN

; .
; .
a AT
trillion CD

would MD
fill VB
all ABN
the AT

about RB
ten CD

a AT

would MD
fill VB
all ABN
the AT

in IN
the AT
city NN
of IN
Philadelphia NP

I PPSS
saw VBD
that CS
I PPSS
would MD
soon RB
run VB
out RP
of IN
buildings NNS
at IN
this DT
rate NN
, ,
so CS
I PPSS
decided VBD
to TO
take VB
another DT
measure NN
-- --
the AT
whole JJ

of IN
Pennsylvania NP

Imagine VB
that CS
there EX

, ,
but CC
instead RB
of IN
snowing VBG
snow NN
, ,
it PPS
snows VBZ
peas NNS
; .
; .
so CS
we PPSS
get VB
the AT
whole JJ
state NN
covered VBN
with IN

, ,
about RB
four CD
feet NNS

You PPSS
can MD
imagine VB
what WDT
it PPS
would MD
look VB
like CS
going VBG
out RP
on IN
the AT
turnpike NN
with IN
the AT

banked VBN
up RP

the AT

covering VBG
the AT

; .
; .
Pennsylvania NP
thus RB
blanketed VBN
would MD
contain VB
about RB
a AT
quintillion CD

But CC
we PPSS
still RB
have HV
a AT
long JJ
way NN
to TO
go VB

Next RB
we PPSS
imagine VB
our PP$
blizzard NN
raging VBG
over IN
all ABN

Africa NP
, ,
all QL
covered VBN
with IN

four CD

; .
; .
then RB
we PPSS
have HV
sextillion CD
peas NNS
. .
Next RB
we PPSS
freeze VB
over RP
the AT
oceans NNS
and CC
cover VB
the AT
whole JJ
earth NN
with IN
peas NNS
, ,
then RB
we PPSS
go VB
out RP
among IN
the AT
neighboring VBG
stars NNS
, ,
collect VB
250 CD
planets NNS
each DT
the AT

the AT
earth NN
, ,
and CC
also RB
cover VB
each DT
of IN
these DTS
with IN
peas NNS
four CD
feet NNS
deep JJ
; .
; .
and CC
then RB
we PPSS
have HV
septillion CD
. .
Finally RB
we PPSS
go VB
into IN
the AT
farthest JJT
reaches NNS
of IN
the AT
Milky JJ-TL
Way NN-TL
; .
; .
we PPSS
get VB
250,000 CD
planets NNS
; .
; .
we PPSS
cover VB
each DT
of IN
these DTS
with IN
our PP$
blanket NN
of IN

and CC
then RB
at IN
last RB
we PPSS
have HV
octillion CD
peas NNS
corresponding VBG
in IN
number NN
to IN
the AT
atoms NNS
in IN
the AT

. .
So RB
you PPSS
see VB
how WQL
small JJ
an AT
atom NN
is BEZ
and CC
how WQL
complicated VBN
you PPSS

A AT-HL

Now RB
although CS
an AT

is BEZ
small JJ
, ,
we PPSS
can MD
still RB
in IN
imagination NN
have HV
a AT
look NN
at IN
it PPO

Let VB
us PPO
focus VB

an AT

and CC
let VB
us PPO
suppose VB
that CS
I PPSS
swallow VB
a AT

Alice NP

Wonderland NP
growing VBG

I PPSS
start VB
growing VBG
rapidly RB
and CC
this DT
calcium NN
atom NN
grows VBZ
along RB

me PPO

I PPSS
shoot VB
up RP
through IN
the AT

out RP

until CS
I PPSS
am BEM
over RP
a AT

fifty CD
million CD

Then RB
this DT
atom NN
of IN
calcium NN
will MD
swell VB
to IN
something PN
like CS
a AT
great JJ
balloon NN
a AT

across IN

a AT

big JJ
enough QLP

put VB

And CC
if CS
you PPSS
should MD
step VB
inside RB
of IN
such ABL
a AT
magnified VBN
atom NN
, ,
according IN
to IN
the AT
physics NN
of IN
forty CD
years NNS
ago RB
, ,
you PPSS
would MD
see VB
circulating VBG
over IN
your PP$

down RP
at IN
the AT

, ,
and CC
under IN
your PP$
feet NNS
, ,
some DTI
twenty CD
luminous JJ
balls NNS
about RB
the AT
size NN
of IN

. .
These DTS
balls NNS
are BER
moving VBG
in IN
great JJ
circles NNS

ellipses NNS

are BER

the AT

the AT

negative JJ
electricity NN
which WDT
by IN

create VB

that WPS
tie VB
this DT

the AT
neighboring VBG

of IN
oxygen NN
and CC
make VB
up RP
the AT
solid NN
structure NN
of IN
my PP$

. .
Since CS
these DTS
electrons NNS
are BER
moving VBG
like CS
planets NNS
, ,
you PPSS
may MD
wonder VB
whether CS
there EX
is BEZ
an AT
atomic JJ
sun NN
at IN
the AT
center NN
of IN
the AT

So CS
you PPSS
look VB
down RP
there RB
and CC
you PPSS
see VB
a AT
tiny JJ

whirling VBG
point NN
about RB

This DT

the AT

the AT

Even RB
if CS

were BED
big JJ
enough QLP

hold VB
a AT

, ,
this DT
nucleus NN

still RB
only RB
about RB

It PPS
is BEZ
this DT

that WPS

holding VBG

it PPS
also RB
contains VBZ
nearly RB
all ABN
the AT

You PPSS
may MD
ask VB
what WDT
else RB
there EX
is BEZ
, ,
and CC
the AT
answer NN
is BEZ
nothing PN
-- --
nothing PN
but IN
empty JJ

And CC
since CS
you PPSS

you PPSS
are BER
nothing PN
much AP

empty JJ

If CS
I PPSS

put VB

in IN
an AT
imaginary JJ

squeeze VB

the AT

we PPSS
squeeze VB
the AT

out IN

a AT

, ,
you PPSS
would MD
get VB
smaller JJR

smaller JJR
until CS
finally RB
when WRB
the AT
last AP

you PPSS

be BE
smaller JJR

that WPS
you PPSS

Someone PN

Music NN-HL

Now RB
this DT
1920 CD
view NN
of IN
the AT

was BEDZ
on IN
the AT
whole NN
a AT
discouraging JJ

For CS
we PPSS
believed VBD
that CS
the AT

obeyed VBD
the AT
law NN
of IN
mechanics NNS

electrodynamics NN

therefore RB
the AT

really RB
just RB

in IN

the AT
whole NN

no AT

So CS
if CS

you PPSS
are BER
just RB
a AT

it PPS

And CC
this DT

this DT

And CC
to TO
