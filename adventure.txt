The AT

One CD

Sometimes RB

I PPSS

As CS

It PPS

that DT

the AT

I PPSS

I PPSS

True RB

only RB

why WRB

twice RB
her PP$

more AP
, ,
perhaps RB

I PPSS

She PPS

Her PP$

strong JJ

I PPSS
could MD
see VB
the AT

a AT

that CS
an AT

anyone PN

As CS
it PPS

in IN
so QL
many AP

something PN

Something PN
clicked VBD

this DT

but CC
I PPSS
treated VBD

circumspectly RB

I PPSS

that CS

for CS
we PPSS
both ABX
kept VBD

When WRB

to TO
help VB
out RP
for IN
a AT
few AP
hours NNS
even VB
my PP$
looking NN
at IN
her PPO

surreptitious JJ
lest CS
my PP$

And CC
then RB
I PPSS
became VBD
aware JJ
that CS
she PPS
, ,
too RB
, ,
glanced VBD
at IN
me PPO
surreptitiously RB

I PPSS
felt VBD
that CS
her PP$

were BED
undressing VBG
me PPO
as CS
if CS
she PPS
were BED
a AT
painter NN

I PPSS
a AT

I PPSS
dismissed VBD
these DTS
feelings NNS
as CS
wishful JJ
thinking NN
but CC
I PPSS
could MD
not *
get VB
it PPO
out IN
of IN
my PP$

that CS
we PPSS
had HVD
a AT
strong JJ
physical JJ
attraction NN
for IN
one DTX
another DT
and CC
we PPSS
both ABX
feared VBD
to TO
dwell VB
on IN
it PPO
because CS

our PP$

When WRB
our PP$

met VBD
the AT
air NN
was BEDZ
filled VBN
with IN
an AT
unuttered JJ
message NN

`` ``

You PPSS

probably RB
experienced VBN
this DT

It PPS

nothing PN
you PPSS

put VB

but CC
the AT
air NN
suddenly RB
fills VBZ
with IN
a AT

Why WRB
she PPS
married VBD
him PPO
I PPSS
do DO
not *

I PPSS
myself PPL
was BEDZ
fond JJ

him PPO
but CC
what WDT
a AT
young JJ

half ABN
his PP$

a AT

He PPS
already RB

all ABN
the AT

Perhaps RB

with IN
my PP$

she PPS
found VBD
a AT
measure NN

some DTI

For IN

then RB
one CD

Uncle NN-TL
