The AT

From IN

A AT

Two CD

The AT

Watson NP

An AT

The AT

The AT

Watson NP

The AT

Watson NP

Though CS
Watson NP

Perhaps RB

Watson NP

The AT

He PPS

His PP$

He PPS

So RB

Without IN

She PPS

People NNS

she PPS

Bobby NP
Joe NP

now RB
, ,
not *
coming VBG

sometimes RB
not *

When WRB
they PPSS
first RB
married VBD
he PPS

been BEN
working VBG
in IN

all ABN

she PPS

Now RB
there EX

not *

Not *
that CS
she PPS

Four CD

five CD

East JJ-TL

so RB
naturally RB
they PPSS

There EX
was BEDZ
no AT
reason NN
for IN
her PPO
to TO
ask VB

they PPSS

Thus RB
a AT
new JJ
pattern NN
of IN
days NNS
began VBD

develop VB

for CS
Granny NP
Albright NP

She PPS

sometimes RB

sometimes RB

They PPSS
stopped VBD
expecting VBG

the AT
next AP

, ,
but CC
only RB
in IN
the AT
next AP
day NN
or CC
two CD

Those DTS
who WPS

driven VBN
hundreds NNS

When WRB
