That's DT+BEZ
what WDT

But CC
his PP$

The AT

off IN

Haney NP
thought VBD

Eyes NNS
that WPS

also RB
bright JJ

burning VBG

Why WRB

he PPS

No RB
, ,
the AT
man NN
was BEDZ
not *
drunk JJ
He PPS
wondered VBD
how WRB
he PPS
got VBD
tied VBN
up RP

this DT
stranger NN

But CC
, ,
of IN

he PPS
remembered VBD
now RB

It PPS
was BEDZ
blurred VBN

after IN
two CD

steady JJ
drinking NN

but CC
the AT
occasion NN

it PPO
came VBD
back RB

him PPO

The AT
stranger NN
, ,
his PP$
head NN
seemingly RB
sunk VBN
in IN
thought NN
, ,
started VBD
to TO
cross VB
the AT
street NN
against IN
the AT
light NN
just RB
as CS
a AT
huge JJ
moving VBG
van NN
roared VBD
through IN
the AT
intersection NN

Brakes NNS
howled VBD
and CC
a AT
horn NN
blared VBD
furiously RB
, ,
but CC
the AT
man NN
would MD
have HV
been BEN
hit VBN
if CS
Phil NP
hadn't HVD*
called VBN
out RP
to IN
him PPO
a AT
second NN
before RB

His PP$
shout NN
had HVD
been BEN
involuntary JJ
, ,
something PN
anybody PN
might MD
have HV
done VBN
without IN
thinking VBG
, ,
on IN
the AT
spur NN
of IN
the AT
moment NN

As CS
a AT
matter NN
of IN
fact NN
, ,
he PPS
wouldn't MD*
have HV
cared VBN
at IN
all ABN
if CS
the AT
guy NN
had HVD
been BEN
hit VBN
. .
Actually RB
, ,
he PPS
regretted VBD
having HVG
opened VBN
his PP$
mouth NN
when WRB
the AT
truck NN
came VBD
to IN
a AT
stop NN
and CC
the AT
angry JJ
driver NN
jumped VBD
down RP
from IN
the AT
cab NN
and CC
walked VBD
back RB
toward IN
them PPO
. .
By IN
then RB
, ,
the AT
stranger NN
was BEDZ
thanking VBG
Haney NP
profusely RB
and CC
had HVD
one CD
arm NN
around IN
his PP$
shoulders NNS
as CS
if CS
he PPS
were BED
an AT
old JJ
friend NN
. .
So CS
the AT
driver NN
started VBD
to TO
curse VB
at IN
both ABX
of IN
them PPO
as CS
if CS
they PPSS
had HVD
been BEN
in IN
a AT
plot NN
together RB
to TO
ruin VB
his PP$
safe-driving NN
record NN

Then RB
the AT
man NN
he PPS
saved VBD
turned VBD
and CC
looked VBD
squarely RB
into IN
the AT
truck NN
driver's NN$
face NN
, ,
without IN
saying VBG
a AT
word NN
. .
Very QL
suddenly RB
, ,
the AT
driver NN
stopped VBD
swearing VBG
at IN
them PPO
, ,
turned VBD
on IN
his PP$
heel NN
and CC
went VBD
back RB
to IN
his PP$
truck NN
. .
Haney NP
hadn't HVD*
given VBN
it PPO
much AP
thought NN
at IN
the AT
time NN
. .
Now RB
he PPS
recalled VBD
it PPO
very QL
clearly RB
, ,
and CC
wondered VBD
what WDT
the AT
truck NN
driver NN
had HVD
seen VBN
in IN
those DTS
eyes NNS
to TO
make VB
him PPO
back VB
off RP

It PPS
must MD
have HV
been BEN
the AT
sort NN
of IN
look NN
that WPS
can MD
call VB
a AT
bluff NN
without IN
saying VBG
a AT
word NN
. .
When WRB
the AT
light NN
went VBD
their PP$
way NN
, ,
they PPSS
went VBD
on RP
across IN
the AT
street NN

And CC
when WRB
the AT
stranger NN
found VBD
out RP
that CS
Phil NP

on IN
the AT

to IN
one CD

his PP$
favorite JJ

he PPS
insisted VBD
on IN
offering VBG

buy VB
drinks NNS
for IN
both ABX

Phil NP
usually RB
went VBD
alone RB
and CC
kept VBD
to IN
himself PPL
, ,
sitting VBG
in IN
a AT
corner NN
and CC
passing VBG
the AT

by IN
nursing VBG
his PP$

But CC
he PPS
decided VBD
he PPS

even RB
though CS

money NN
at IN

Phil NP

Now RB
he PPS
wondered VBD
if CS
it PPS

He PPS
really RB
didn't DOD*
take VB

he PPS
began VBD

When WRB

finally RB

he PPS

even RB

Haney NP
