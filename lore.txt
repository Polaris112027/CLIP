This DT

It PPS

What WDT

noteworthy JJ
about IN
this DT
large JJ

that CS
, ,

There EX

two CD

Undoubtedly RB

Vocational JJ-HL

I PPSS

four CD

I PPSS

with IN

First OD

Second OD

however RB

slow JJ

prospective JJ

these DTS

earlier RBR

Third OD
, ,
the AT
significance NN

is BEZ
that CS

Fourth OD

the AT

This DT
last AP
point NN

Practically RB

two CD

Similarly RB
