The AT

When WRB

Observations NNS

the AT

of IN
a AT

a AT

those DTS
using VBG

in IN
some DTI

give VB
otherwise RB
unobtainable JJ
information NN
about IN

Radio NN

already RB

unexpected JJ
experimental JJ

The AT

much QL
higher JJR

although CS

near IN
3 CD

is BEZ

that DT

This DT

suggests VBZ
a AT

high JJ

at IN
the AT

, ,
although CS
there EX
is BEZ
the AT
possibility NN
that CS

may MD
be BE
a AT

of IN
both ABX

For IN
the AT

the AT

definitely RB
not *
like CS
the AT

Of IN

Mars NP

twice RB

the AT

in IN
reasonable JJ

The AT

limited VBN

but CC
again RB
the AT

No AT

The AT
study NN
of IN
the AT
radio NN
emission NN
of IN
the AT

began VBD
with IN
the AT

by IN
Dicke NP

This DT
was BEDZ
followed VBN

Piddington NP

Minnett NP
( (

. .
They PPSS
deduced VBD

that CS
the AT

the AT

that CS

came VBD
about RB

Full JJ-TL

Piddington NP

Minnett NP
explained VBD

that CS
rocklike JJ
materials NNS

likely JJ

make VB
up RP
the AT

be BE
partially QL
transparent JJ

although CS
opaque JJ

The AT

then RB
be BE
assumed VBN

originate VB
at IN
the AT

while CS
the AT

where WRB

Since CS
the AT
absorption NN

in IN
rocklike JJ
material NN
varies VBZ
with IN
wave NN

it PPS
should MD

possible JJ

that CS

if CS

Proof NN-HL

The AT

If CS

valid JJ

how WRB

we PPSS

The AT

We PPSS

find VB

such JJ
that CS

and CC
so CS
that CS
Af NN

For IN
each DT
i NN

let VB
Af NN
. .
Since CS
Af NN
are BER
distinct JJ
prime JJ

the AT
polynomials NNS
Af NN
are BER
relatively RB
prime JJ
( (
Theorem NN-TL

Thus RB
there EX
are BER

such JJ
that CS

Note VB
also RB
that CS
if CS
Af NN

then RB
Af NN
is BEZ
divisible JJ

the AT

because CS
Af NN

each DT

We PPSS

show VB
that CS

behave VB
in IN
the AT
manner NN
described VBN
in IN

Let VB
Af NN

Since CS
Af NN
and CC
P NP
divides VBZ
Af NN
for IN
Af NN

we PPSS
have HV
Af NN

Thus RB
the AT
Af NN

projections NNS
which WDT
correspond VB

some DTI
direct-sum NN

We PPSS
wish VB

show VB
that CS
the AT

exactly RB

It PPS

clear JJ
that CS
each DT

Af NN
for CS
if CS
**ya NN

in IN
the AT

then RB
Af NN

so RB
Af NN
because CS
Af NN

divisible JJ

Conversely RB
, ,
suppose VB
that CS
**ya NN

in IN
the AT

Af NN

If CS
Af NN

then JJ
Af NN

divisible JJ
by IN
Af NN

so RB
Af NN

i.e. RB

Af NN

But CC
then RB
it PPS
is BEZ
immediate JJ
that DT
Af NN

i.e. RB
, ,
that CS
**ya NN

This DT
completes VBZ
the AT
proof NN
of IN
statement NN
( (
A NP

. .
It PPS
is BEZ
certainly RB
clear JJ
that CS
the AT
subspaces NNS
Af NN
are BER
invariant JJ
under IN
T NN
. .
If CS
Af NN
is BEZ
the AT
operator NN
induced VBN
on IN
Af NN
by IN
T NN
, ,
then RB
evidently RB
Af NN
, ,
because CS
by IN
definition NN
Af NN
is BEZ
0 CD
on IN
the AT
subspace NN
Af NN
. .
This DT
shows VBZ
that CS
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
for IN
Af NN
divides VBZ
Af NN
. .
Conversely RB
, ,
let VB
G NP
be BE
any DTI
polynomial NN
such JJ
that CS
Af NN
. .
Then RB
Af NN
. .
Thus RB
Af NN
is BEZ
divisible JJ
by IN
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
P NP
of IN
T NN
, ,
i.e. RB
, ,
Af NN
divides VBZ
Af NN
. .
It PPS
is BEZ
easily RB
seen VBN
that CS
Af NN
divides VBZ
G NP

Hence RB
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
for IN
Af NN
is BEZ
Af NN

Then RB

The AT

and CC
each DT

is BEZ
a AT
polynomial NN
in IN

Proof NN-HL
. .-HL
We PPSS
have HV
just RB
observed VBN
that CS
we PPSS
can MD
write VB
Af NN
where WRB
D NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
and CC
N NN
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
, ,
and CC
where WRB
D NN
and CC
N NN
not *
only RB
commute VB
but CC
are BER
polynomials NNS
in IN
T NN

Now RB
suppose VB
that CS
we PPSS
also RB
have HV
Af NN
where WRB
D' NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
, ,
N' NN
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
, ,
and CC
Af NN
. .
We PPSS
shall MD
prove VB
that CS
Af NN
. .
Since CS
D' NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
with IN
one CD
another DT
and CC
Af NN
, ,
we PPSS
see VB
that CS
D' NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
with IN
T NN
. .
Thus RB
D' NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
with IN
any DTI
polynomial NN
in IN
T NN
; .
; .
hence RB
they PPSS
commute VB
with IN
D NN
and CC
with IN
N NN

Now RB
we PPSS
have HV
Af NN
or CC
Af NN
and CC
all ABN
four CD
of IN
these DTS
operators NNS
commute VB
with IN
one CD
another DT
. .
Since CS
D NN
and CC
D' NN
are BER
both ABX
diagonalizable JJ
and CC
they PPSS
commute VB
, ,
they PPSS
are BER
simultaneously RB
diagonalizable JJ
, ,
and CC
Af NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
. .
Since CS
N NN
and CC
N' NN
are BER
both ABX
nilpotent JJ
and CC
they PPSS
commute VB
, ,
the AT
operator NN
Af NN
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
; .
; .
for CS
, ,
using VBG
the AT
fact NN
that DT
N NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
Af NN
and CC
so RB
when WRB
R NP
is BEZ
sufficiently QL
large JJ
every AT
term NN
in IN
this DT
expression NN
for IN
Af NN
will MD
be BE
0 CD
. .
( (
Actually RB
, ,
a AT
nilpotent JJ
operator NN
on IN
an AT
n-dimensional NN

must MD
have HV
its PP$
T NP

0 CD

if CS
we PPSS
take VB
Af NN
above RB

that DT

be BE
large JJ
enough QLP

It PPS
then RB
follows VBZ
that CS
Af NN

, ,
but CC
this DT
is BEZ
not *
obvious JJ
from IN

Now RB
Af NN
is BEZ
a AT
diagonalizable JJ
operator NN
which WDT
is BEZ
also RB
nilpotent JJ

Such ABL
an AT
operator NN
is BEZ
obviously RB
the AT
zero NN
operator NN
; .
; .
for CS
since CS
it PPS
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
, ,
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
for IN
this DT
operator NN
is BEZ
of IN
the AT
form NN
Af NN
for IN
some DTI
Af NN
; .
; .
but CC
then RB
since CS
the AT
operator NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
, ,
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
cannot MD*
have HV
a AT
repeated VBN

; .
; .
hence RB
Af NN
and CC
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
is BEZ
simply RB
x NN
, ,
which WDT
says VBZ
the AT

Thus RB
we PPSS

Lemma NN-HL

In IN

f-plane NN
of IN
any DTI
ordinary JJ
point NN
of IN
the AT

, ,
the AT
function NN
f NN
is BEZ
a AT
single-valued JJ
, ,
continuous JJ
function NN
. .
Proof NN-HL
. .-HL
We PPSS
first RB
show VB
that CS
the AT
function NN
is BEZ
single-valued JJ
in IN
some DTI
neighborhood NN
. .
With IN
the AT
vertex NN
at IN
Af NN
in IN
the AT
C-plane NN
we PPSS
assume VB
that CS
Af NN
is BEZ
the AT
parametric JJ
location NN
on IN
C NN
of IN
an AT
ordinary JJ
intersection NN
Q NN
between IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
. .
In IN
the AT
f-plane NN
the AT
coordinates NNS
of IN
the AT
corresponding JJ
point NN
are BER
Af NN
. .
We PPSS
know VB
that CS
in IN
the AT
C-plane NN
both ABX
C NN
and CC
Af NN
are BER
analytic JJ
. .
In IN
the AT
C-plane NN
we PPSS
construct VB
a AT
set NN
of IN
rectangular JJ
Cartesian JJ
coordinates NNS
u NN
, ,
V NP
with IN
the AT
origin NN
at IN
Q NN
and CC
such JJ
that CS
both ABX
C NN
and CC
Af NN
have HV
finite JJ
slope NN
at IN
Q NN
. .
Near IN
Q NN
, ,
both ABX
curves NNS
can MD
be BE
represented VBN
by IN
analytic JJ
functions NNS
of IN
U NP
. .
In IN
a AT
neighborhood NN
of IN
Q NN
the AT
difference NN
between IN
these DTS
functions NNS
is BEZ
also RB
a AT
single-valued JJ
, ,
analytic JJ
function NN
of IN
U NP
. .
Furthermore RB
, ,
one PN
can MD
find VB
a AT
neighborhood NN
of IN
Q NN
in IN
which WDT
the AT
difference NN
function NN
is BEZ
monotone JJ
, ,
for CS
since CS
it PPS
is BEZ
analytic JJ
it PPS
can MD
have HV
only RB
a AT
finite JJ
number NN
of IN
extrema NNS
in IN
any DTI
interval NN
. .
Now RB
, ,
to TO
find VB
Af NN
, ,
one PN
needs VBZ
the AT
intersection NN
of IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
near IN
Q NN
. .
But CC
Af NN
is BEZ
just RB
the AT
curve NN
Af NN
translated VBN
without IN
rotation NN
through IN
a AT
small JJ
arc NN
, ,
for CS
Af NN
is BEZ
always RB
obtained VBN
by IN
rotating VBG
C NN
through IN
exactly RB
90-degrees NNS
. .
The AT
arc NN
is BEZ
itself PPL
a AT
segment NN
of IN
an AT
analytic JJ
curve NN
. .
Thus RB
if CS
E NP
is BEZ
sufficiently QL
small JJ
, ,
there EX
can MD
be BE
only RB
one CD
intersection NN
of IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
near IN
Q NN
, ,
for CS
if CS
there EX
were BED
more AP
than IN
one CD
intersection NN
for IN
every AT
E NP
then RB
the AT
difference NN
between IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
near IN
Q NN
would MD
not *
be BE
a AT
monotone JJ
function NN
. .
Therefore RB
, ,
Af NN
is BEZ
single-valued JJ
near IN
Q NN
. .
It PPS
is BEZ
also RB
seen VBN
that CS
Af NN
, ,
since CS
the AT
change NN
from IN
Af NN
to IN
Af NN
is BEZ
accomplished VBN
by IN
a AT
continuous JJ
translation NN
. .
Thus RB
Af NN
is BEZ
also RB
continuous JJ
at IN
Af NN
, ,
and CC
in IN
a AT
neighborhood NN
of IN
Af NN
which WDT
does DOZ
not *
contain VB
a AT
tangent JJ
point NN
. .
We PPSS
turn VB
now RB
to IN
the AT
set NN
of IN
tangent JJ
points NNS
on IN
the AT
graph NN
. .
This DT
set NN
must MD
consist VB
of IN
isolated VBN
points NNS
and CC
closed VBN
intervals NNS
. .
The AT
fact NN
that CS

can MD
not *
be BE
any DTI
limit NN
points NNS
of IN
the AT
set NN
except IN
in IN
closed VBN

follows VBZ
from IN
the AT

used VBN

The AT

It PPS

Moreover RB

This DT

Since CS

we PPSS

: :
What WDT

We PPSS

our PP$
tendency NN

develop VB
a AT

instead RB
of IN
seeing VBG

as CS
part NN
of IN
a AT
continuum NN
, ,
each DT
important JJ
in IN
its PP$
own JJ
right NN
. .
This DT
problem NN
is BEZ
perhaps RB
as QL
old JJ
as CS

casework NN
itself PPL

Almost RB
three CD

Bertha NP
Reynolds NP
undertook VBD
a AT
study NN
of IN

because RB
of IN
her PP$
conviction NN
that CS

an AT
important JJ
but CC
neglected VBN
place NN
in IN
our PP$
network NN
of IN

Her PP$
conclusion NN
has HVZ
been BEN
borne VBN
out RP
in IN
the AT
experience NN
of IN
many AP

: :
`` ``

Thus RB

Again RB

one CD

Another DT
problem NN

who WPS

If CS

However RB

the AT

how WRB

This DT

we PPSS

Fifth RB

If CS

On IN

Fromm's NP$
analysis NN

in IN
the AT

For IN

The AT

Fromm NP

Another DT

For IN

He PPS
